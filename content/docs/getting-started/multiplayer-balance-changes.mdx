## Jokers

There are **10 added multiplayer jokers**. All jokers added in the multiplayer mod are designed
to **interact with your opponent** and will not show up in single player games.
See page 11 for a list of added jokers.

### Disabled Jokers
The following jokers are unavailable in multiplayer due to their interaction with boss blinds:
- **Chicot**
- **Matador**
- **Mr. Bones**
- **Luchador**

### Changes
**Hanging Chad** has been reworked to **retrigger the first 2 cards once**.

## Celestial Packs

In celestial packs there is an added planet called "**Asteroid**," which **removes one level** from your opponent's highest levelled planet.

## Tarot Packs

"**Justice**" card has been **removed** from the game.

## Glass Cards

Glass cards are now **1.5x** instead of 2x multiplier and can **only** be found in:

- Standard packs
- Spectrals that spawn cards (Grim, Incantation, and Familiar)
